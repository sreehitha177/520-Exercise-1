Strategy 1: Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

{problem statement}

Please solve this step by step: 
1. First, try to understand what the problem is asking for 
2. Next, think about appropriate approach or algorithm to proceed with 
3. Keep edge cases in mind to handle
4. Write the Python function with structured logic




Strategy 2: Self-Planning

{problem statement}

Before writing code, let's create a detailed plan in two phases:  
1. PLANNING PHASE:    
   - Analyze the problem requirements   
   - Identify input/output specs   
   - List all constraints and edge cases   
   - Choose the most appropriate approach or algorithm   

2. IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:    
   - Write the function based on your plan   
   - Include error handling and edge cases
   - stick to your planning phase 

Please start with your planning phase:
